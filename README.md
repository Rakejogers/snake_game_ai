> An AI-powered Snake game using PyTorch for training a neural network to play the game.

## Overview

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using deep reinforcement learning. The agent is trained using a neural network to maximize the score by avoiding obstacles and consuming food.

## Features

- **Deep Q-Learning**: The AI uses a deep Q-network to predict the best moves.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: The model is built using PyTorch, with fully connected layers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The agent's performance improves over time as it learns from its actions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need Python and the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting results)
- Pygame (for game visuals)
- IPython (for plotting)

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib pygame
```

## Usage
Simple run the agent file to start the training and gameplay
```bash
python agent.py
```

## Video Demo
Watch the AI play Snake
